Description: Fountain View Hall's event attendance & revenue tracker.

Pseudo code
Declare variables for:
guests, events, revenue and largest event

Make constants for:
Large events by customer count, discount percent for large events

Main loop:

    get input for event name

    set guest count and projected revenue to something in loop range.

    start guest loop:
        try to cast guest count to an integer
        loop until valid or sentinel value

    start revenue loop
        try to cast revenue count to an integer
        loop until valid or sentinel value
    Calculate Discount

    increment event count, total guest, and total revenue
    check if it was the largest and if so store it as such
    append all info to data frame
    print formatted
